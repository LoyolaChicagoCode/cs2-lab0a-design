# Individual project

# Functional requirements

*Recurring rainfall calculation:* Design a program called `Rainfall` that reads a list of numbers from the standard input (console) representing daily rainfall amounts as entered by a user. Produce the average of the non-negative values in the list up to end of file. There may be negative numbers in the list.

# Nonfunctional requirements

- Performance: For each additional input item, the program should produce a small, finite number of steps.
- Scalability: The program should handle arbitrarily large input sequences.
- Testability: Give some initial thought to the way your program could support automatic testing (without, say, the user entering any data or reading any data from an external file).

# Deliverables

- Pseudocode: sketch your solution using high-level pseudocode. Emphasize concepts and functionality rather than syntactic detail.
- Reflection: document any key design decisions you faced and how you made one choice over the other(s). Include your initial thoughts on testability here.

# Submission

- Submit your actual work inline or paste the link to an external document (e.g., Google doc).
